2. Write a function which, given a year as a number, returns whether that number is a leap year.

2000 -> true
1900 -> false
2016 -> true

3. Write a function which takes an array of integers > 0 and returns the first integer which does not appear in that array.
[1,2,5] -> 3
[1,2,3,4,5] -> 6
[3,4,5] -> 1

4. Write a function which takes an array of integers and returns an array with any duplicate integers removed.
[1,1,2,3,1,2,3] -> [1,2,3]
[1,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4] -> [1,4,2]

5. Write function that translates a text to Pig Latin, and another that translates back. English is translated to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every word, moving it to the end of the word and adding "ay".

"The quick brown fox" -> "Hetay uickqay rownbay oxfay".

6. Write a function which takes in two arrays and determines if they contain the same number of the same values.
[], [] -> true
[2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3] -> false
["a", "c", "b"], ["a", "b", "c"] -> true
[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1] -> false

7. Write a function which takes in an array of numbers and a max cutoff value, and returns a new array with elements limited by the cutoff value.
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], 4 -> [1,2,3,4,4,4,4,4]
[1,5,7,3,1,5,7], 3 -> [1,3,3,3,1,3,3]

8. Write a function which takes no input and returns an array of 10 distinct randomly generated integers between 1 and 100.

-> [48, 5, 32, 2, 10, 11, 34, 95, 82, 93] (good!)
-> [1, 1, 24, 63, 45, 84, 17, 11, 59, 13] (bad - duplicated number)

9. Write a function which takes two sorted lists and merges them into a new sorted list.

[1,2,5,6,9], [3,4,5,10] -> [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,9,10]
[], [] -> []
[-1, 0, 1], [-2, 2] -> [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

10. Write a function which accepts two arrays as input. The function should remove all the items from the shorter array, and add them to the end of the longer array. If both arrays are the same length, the function should do nothing. This function does not need to return a value. 

```javascript
var numbers = ['four', 'eleven']
var animals = ['cat', 'bat', 'dolphin']
arrayTransfer(numbers, animals)
console.log(numbers) // []
console.log(animals) // ['cat', 'bat', 'dolphin', 'four', 'eleven']

```

11. Write a function that uses `Math.random()` to generate a random number between 0-1. Replace all the 3's with 8's, and replace all the 7's with 1's, then return this number. Note that this function should return a `number`, not a `string`. 

12. Write a function which accepts a sentence as a string, and returns the longest word in that sentence.

'I ate toast for breakfast' -> 'breakfast'


13. Write a function which accepts a sentence as a string. Capitalize the first letter of each word of the string, and return that. 

'I ate toast for breakfast' -> 'I Ate Toast For Breakfast'


14. Write a function which takes two dates as strings in the format 'YYYY/MM/DD' and returns the number of days between them.
'1998/01/24', '1999/01/25' -> 366

15. Write a function called `add` that adds two numbers together, and returns the result. The function must be defined such that it can be called in two different ways to achieve the same result. See the example below:

```javascript
var seven = add(5,2) // returns 7
seven = add(5)(2) // also returns 7

function add(x){
  return function(y){
    return x + y;
  };
}

var addTwo = add(2);

addTwo(4) === 6; // true
add(3)(4) === 7; // true
```

16. Write a function which takes one argument, and returns true if that argument is a whole number (a non-negative integer, e.g. 0, 1, 5, 21, 1000, etc). If the argument is negative, is a decimal number, or is not a number at all, return false. 

17. Write a function which returns a random integer from 1 to 10.


18. Cannot change the initial i value of the loop and must print all integers from 100 to 1 inclusive
      for( let i = 0; ... ; ... ; ) {
        // code here
      }
